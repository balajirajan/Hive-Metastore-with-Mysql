Hive-Metastore-with-Mysql
=========================

Configuring  the Hive metastore database with Mysql:

Hive comes configured to use Derby as the metastore. But it can support only one active user at a time and is not certified for production use. The solution to supporting multiple users is to use a standalone database.
MySQL is a popular choice for the standalone metastore.
